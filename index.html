        In the broadest possible terms, a gift box is any box, basket, or
        another container that holds a variety of smallish gifts. The gifts can
        have a similar theme or be completely random, depending on what you
        think the recipient would most enjoy.

        The basic and primary role of the gift box is to provide a complete
        protection to the item inside but in a beautiful appearance. Apart from
        protection, it should always be appealing enough to create curiosity.

        We often give gifts to re-confirm or establish our connection with
        others, which means that they're a reflection of both the giver and the
        receiver, as well as their unique relationship. Giving a gift to someone
        we care about allows us to communicate our feelings and appreciation for
        them.
